                 is an island country in South Asia. It lies in the Indian Ocean, southwest of the Bay of Bengal,
                 separated from the Indian peninsula by the Gulf of Mannar and the Palk Strait.

                    and ethnicities. The Sinhalese people form the majority of the nation's population, followed by the Tamils,
                    who are the largest minority group and are concentrated in northern Sri Lanka; both groups have played an
                    influential role in the island's history. Other long-established groups include the Moors, Indian Tamils,
                    Burghers, Malays, Chinese, and Vedda.

                                consists of golden lion holding a kastane sword in its right fore-paw in a maroon background with
                                four gold bo leaves, one in each corner. This is bordered by gold, and to its left are two vertical
                                stripes of equal size in teal and orange, with the orange stripe closest to the lion. The lion and the
                                maroon background represent the Sinhalese, while the saffron border and four bo leaves represent concepts of
                                meththa, karuṇā, muditā and upecka respectively with lion.

                            the home to two main traditional cultures: the Sinhalese ( centred in Kandy and Anuradhapura ) and the Tamil
                            ( centred in Jaffna ). Tamils co-existed with the Sinhalese people since then, and the early mixing rendered
                            the two ethnic groups almost physically indistinguishable. The Ancient Sri Lanka is marked for its genius
                            in hydraulic engineering and architecture. British colonial culture also has influenced later periods.
